# Weather App Project

## 1. Goal of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to showcase proficiency in React, SASS and TypeScript through the development of a user-friendly weather application. The app allows users to effortlessly search for and view the current weather conditions of any chosen city or address.

## 2. Deployment

The application is currently deployed and accessible at [Weather App](https://weather-app-mu-five-84.vercel.app/). Feel free to visit this link to experience the functionality and interface of the application.

## 3. Description

This weather application features a straightforward and engaging user interface with three distinct screens:

1. **Home Screen:** Presents the app's title, a brief description, and a button to navigate to the weather search functionality.
2. **Search Screen:** Users can input a desired city or address to fetch weather details.
3. **Weather Display Screen:** Displays comprehensive weather information such as the city's name, temperature, sky conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## 4. Outcome

The outcome of this project is a functional, responsive, and visually appealing weather application that successfully integrates React and TypeScript technologies. Users can obtain real-time weather data with ease, enhancing their decision-making related to travel, events, and daily activities based on weather conditions.

## 5. Technology Stack

The project leverages a robust stack comprising:

- **React:** For building the user interface with state-of-the-art features.
- **TypeScript:** Ensuring type safety and enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **SASS:** For advanced styling capabilities and efficient CSS management.
- **HTML:** Structuring the content of the application.

## 6. Vision

The future vision of the project is to include historical weather data. This expansion will allow users to view a history of weather conditions for the past 5 or 14 days in addition to the current weather information. This feature aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of weather patterns and trends for any given location.

## 7. Project Stage

The project is currently in an ongoing development phase. The core functionality is implemented and operational, with future updates planned to incorporate historical weather data and enhance user experience further.
